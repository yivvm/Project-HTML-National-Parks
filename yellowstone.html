            <span style="font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;">Y</span>ellowstone National Park<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> is a national park located in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established by the 42nd U.S. Congress with the Yellowstone National Park Protection Act and signed into law by President Ulysses S. Grant on March 1, 1872.<sup>[4]</sup> Yellowstone was the first national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the first national park in the world.<sup>[2]</sup> The park is known for its wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially the Old Faithful geyser, one of its most popular.<sup>[5]</sup> While it represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests ecoregion.

            History<span style="font-size:15px;"><sup>[6]</sup></span>
        </h2>
        <p>
            The park contains the headwaters of the Yellowstone River, from which it takes its historical name. Near the end of the 18th century, French trappers named the river Roche Jaune, which is probably a translation of the Hidatsa name Mi tsi a-da-zi ("Yellow Stone River"). Later, American trappers rendered the French name in English as "Yellow Stone". Although it is commonly believed that the river was named for the yellow rocks seen in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, the Native American name source is unclear.

            Geography
        </h2>
        <p>
            Yellowstone is 2,219,789 acres (8,983 km2; 3,468 sq mi) in area, larger than either of the states of Rhode Island or Delaware. Rivers and lakes cover five percent of the land area, with the largest water body being Yellowstone Lake at 87,040 acres (352 km2; 136 sq mi). Yellowstone Lake is up to 400 feet (120 m) deep and has 110 miles (180 km) of shoreline. At an elevation of 7,733 feet (2,357 m) above sea level, Yellowstone Lake is the largest high-elevation lake in North America. Forests comprise 80 percent of the land area of the park; most of the rest is grassland.

            Geology
        </h2>
        <h3 style="text-decoration-line: underline ;">
            Volcanism
        </h3>
        <p>
            The Yellowstone Caldera is the largest volcanic system in North America, and worldwide it is only rivaled by the Lake Toba Caldera on Sumatra.
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-color:darkblue;">
            Geysers and the hydrothermal system
        </h3>
        <p>
            At least 1,283 geysers have erupted in Yellowstone. Of these, an average of 465 are active in a given year. Yellowstone contains at least 10,000 geothermal features altogether, including geysers, hot springs, mudpots, and fumaroles. Over half of the world's geysers and hydrothermal features are concentrated in Yellowstone.

        <h3 style="color:darkblue; text-decoration-line: underline; text-decoration-color:darkblue;">
            Earthquakes
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yellowstone experiences thousands of small earthquakes every year, virtually all of which are undetectable to people.
